# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the Dashboard with a Knowledge Board page that displays comprehensive information about hospital licenses and regulatory requirements.

**Planned changes:**
- Create new KnowledgeBoard page component displaying hospital licensing information
- Display license types, categories, and regulatory compliance requirements based on reference document from ResearchGate
- Update routing to replace '/dashboard' with '/knowledge-board'
- Update Navigation component to show 'Knowledge Board' link instead of 'Dashboard'
- Apply existing enterprise design theme (white background, deep blue text) to Knowledge Board
- Add multiple CTAs throughout the page (hero, mid-content, footer) encouraging demo bookings

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate to a Knowledge Board page that provides detailed information about hospital licenses, regulatory requirements, and compliance standards, with multiple opportunities to book a demo or consultation.
