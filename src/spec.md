## Summary
**Goal:** Redesign the Network Directory page to match McKinsey's Our People page professional card-based layout and filtering system.

**Planned changes:**
- Update NetworkDirectory.tsx layout to use a responsive grid of profile cards matching McKinsey's design
- Implement McKinsey-style card styling with appropriate borders, shadows, hover effects, and typography hierarchy
- Add enhanced filtering system with stakeholder category, location, and specialty filters
- Create profile detail views that show comprehensive stakeholder information
- Update page spacing and whitespace to match McKinsey's generous layout structure

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a professional, McKinsey-style directory with card-based profiles, advanced filtering options, and detailed profile views when clicking on stakeholders.
