# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update dropdown/select component styling to display white text on Royal Teal background when opened.

**Planned changes:**
- Add global CSS rules in frontend/index.css to style dropdown option elements with white text color and Royal Teal background
- Update Tailwind configuration in frontend/tailwind.config.js to ensure Royal Teal color token is defined and available
- Apply styling consistently across all dropdown components including Careers, Vendors, Ambulance Services, NGO Listing, and Admin Dashboard pages
- Ensure hover and focus states maintain white text visibility against Royal Teal background

**User-visible outcome:** All dropdown menus across the application display options with white text on a Royal Teal background when opened, providing consistent visual styling that matches the platform's color scheme.
