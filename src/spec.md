## Summary
**Goal:** Update the entire site's visual theme and color scheme to match the professional McKinsey healthcare business-building page style.

**Planned changes:**

- Update typography (font family, weights, sizing hierarchy) to match McKinsey's style
- Update Navigation component styling to match McKinsey's header design
- Update Home page hero section to match McKinsey's hero layout and button design
- Update card components across all pages to match McKinsey's card design patterns

**User-visible outcome:** The entire site will have a refined, professional appearance matching McKinsey's healthcare business page aesthetic, with consistent colors, typography, spacing, and component styling throughout.
