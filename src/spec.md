## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the AI chatbot functionality on the Contact page and update the platform color theme to Royal Teal and Royal White.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement a functional AI chatbot widget on the Contact page with message input, send button, and message display area
- Update the entire platform color scheme to use Royal Teal as the primary accent color for buttons, links, and interactive elements
- Apply Royal White as the background and neutral color throughout all pages
- Ensure color theme consistency across all pages including Home, About Us, Solutions, Network Directory, Careers, Vendors, Ambulance Services, NGO Listing, Dashboard, Contact, and legal pages
- Update navigation, footer, and all UI components to reflect the new color scheme
- Maintain appropriate Royal Teal accent in dark mode variations

**User-visible outcome:** Users can interact with a working AI chatbot on the Contact page to get assistance and support. The entire platform now features a cohesive Royal Teal and Royal White color scheme across all pages and components.
