  "summary": "The diff implements a Knowledge Board page to replace the Dashboard, including routing changes, navigation updates, and comprehensive content about hospital licensing and regulatory compliance. The implementation aligns well with most requirements, though some image references and a few specific acceptance criteria cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-239",
      "requirement": "Previous '/dashboard' route is removed or replaced",
      "reason": "While the '/knowledge-board' route is added in App.tsx, the diff shows Dashboard.tsx still exists in the modified files list. The truncated App.tsx content doesn't show explicit removal of a previous '/dashboard' route.",
