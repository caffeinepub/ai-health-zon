  "summary": "All 9 requirements have been successfully implemented. PIN code input fields with manual entry were added to all four registration forms (Careers, Vendors, AmbulanceServices, NgoListing). Auto-fill functionality that populates city and state fields when a valid 6-digit PIN code is entered has been implemented for all forms using a dedicated PIN code lookup utility. The implementation uses the India Post API for lookup and allows users to manually edit auto-filled fields.",
