  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements correctly, including PIN code auto-fill, post office field addition, read-only location fields, and utility updates. However, visual styling for locked fields is not evident in the diff (likely implemented via existing disabled class styling but not explicitly visible). The 'nation' field is referenced as 'country' in code, and while district/state/postOffice are made read-only, the JSX markup confirming the disabled attribute is truncated in all form files.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Visual styling indicates fields are locked (e.g., reduced opacity, disabled cursor)",
      "reason": "The diff shows validation and state management for locked fields, but no explicit CSS styling or className changes for visual indicators like reduced opacity or disabled cursor are visible in the truncated code. The disabled attribute may provide default browser styling, but custom visual indicators are not evident.",
