  "summary": "The diff implements most styling requirements to match McKinsey's design. Colors, typography, navigation, hero section, cards, buttons, spacing, and footer have all been updated. However, the diff summary lacks explicit evidence for dark mode variants and some detailed acceptance criteria like specific card hover effects and section spacing measurements.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-67",
      "requirement": "Color scheme works for both light and dark mode variants",
      "reason": "While dark mode CSS variables are defined in frontend/src/index.css, the diff does not show evidence of testing or visual verification that the color scheme actually works correctly in both modes. The acceptance criteria requires confirmation that both modes function properly.",
