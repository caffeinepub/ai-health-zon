  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to the homepage (Home.tsx) and supporting files, but the diff for Home.tsx is truncated at a critical point. Based on the visible content, the existing hero carousel, why-choose-us section, solutions cards, and metrics are present. However, there is no visible evidence of the two new required sections (Clean Claim Intelligence and Knowledge Board) in the truncated diff. Navigation.tsx mentions adding a 'Clean Claim Intelligence link' to the menu, but this is distinct from adding a dedicated homepage section.",
