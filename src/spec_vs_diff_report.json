  "summary": "The implementation successfully removes gradient text from text overlays on images across Home.tsx, HealthcareSupportSystem.tsx, NetworkMap.tsx, and Onboarding.tsx by replacing gradient classes with solid color text (white with drop-shadow for hero sections). Gradient text is preserved for headings on solid backgrounds throughout all pages. All three requirements are fully implemented.",

The BuildRequest specifically targets Home.tsx hero carousel (REQ-105), HealthcareSupportSystem.tsx video thumbnails (REQ-106), and ensuring gradient text only on solid backgrounds across all pages (REQ-107), but does not explicitly request changes to AboutUs.tsx.",
